The YAML files in this directory will be merged into the content item retrieved from content store before the
page is rendered.

The content of each YAML file in alphabetical order will appear in `.links.content_extensions[]` in the content item.

Because this is happening in the frontend application, there's no need to adhere to any particular schema for these
files, but you must make sure that the structure of each file matches the structure the ruby code expects it to have.
