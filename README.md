# Collections

Collections serves the GOV.UK navigation pages and organisation pages. Search API is used to make the pages dynamic e.g. the latest changes for Topics, Organisations and Mainstream browse pages.

At time of writing, it also serves the priority campaign pages. See the [Campaign pages](docs/campaign-pages.md) manual for more details.
