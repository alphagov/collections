name: Accordion
description: A group of expanding/collapsing sections
body: |
  The accordion has several features:

  - Opening a section changes the URL so that if the URL is shared or the user uses the back button on the next page, the page will load at that part of the accordion with it expanded.
  - If JavaScript is disabled the accordion expands fully. All of the accordion functionality (including the icons and aria attributes) are added using JavaScript.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The accordion must:

  - indicate to users that each section can be expanded and collapsed
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - use a button element for section toggling for easier keyboard use and to prevent user confusion
  - allow users to open or close all sections at once

  When JavaScript is unavailable the accordion must:

  - be fully expanded
  - not be marked as expandable
